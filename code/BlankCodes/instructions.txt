To make a new page:

1. Add a new WebForm to the project and name the page based on the page name indicated
   on Web.Config if the new page is an entry point to a different part of the site.
   Otherwise, if the form only links to a subset of pages, simply assign any appropriate
   name for the page.
   
2. Go to the HTML view of the WebForm.

3. Open and copy the contents of HTMLPageLayout.txt under the BlankCodes folder.

4. Replace the HTML code on the new WebForm with the code copied from HTMLPageLayout.txt
   but retain the "Page" declaration line (first line), i.e. <%@Page language="C#" .... %>

5. Open the codebehind page of the WebForm and change the base class System.Web.UI.Page to
   ViewController
   
6. For codes you need to put on the Page_Load function, you must place those instead on the
   the OnPreRender function.  To override ViewController.OnPreRender(), override OnPreRender
   by writing a new function - type override, then space, then select OnPreRender on the
   intellisense list.
   
   CHECK THE DOCUMENT BlankCodeBehind.txt UNDER BlankCodes folder FOR DETAILS.
